I'm a data science student at General Assembly in Boston. In my previous life, I was a field biologist and animal behaviorist, but my current interests include natural language processing, consumer or patient behavior, recommendation algorithms, and social network analysis. When I'm not data science-ing, I'm probably rock climbing.
